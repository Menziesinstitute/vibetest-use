## Quick Start

To get started quickly, follow these steps to install dependencies and set up the environment.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Setup

To set up the Vibetest server, you need to configure it through the command line interface. 

### 1) Claude Code

Add the MCP server using the CLI:

```bash
# Add MCP server via CLI
claude mcp add vibetest /full/path/to/vibetest-use/.venv/bin/vibetest-mcp -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Once added, you can check the server status:

```bash
# Test in Claude Code
> claude

> /mcp 
  âŽ¿  MCP Server Status

     â€¢ vibetest: connected
```

### 2) Cursor

1. Open **Cursor Settings**.
2. Click on **MCP** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Add Server** or the "+" button.
4. Manually edit the configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibetest": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/vibetest-use/.venv/bin/vibetest-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Website
